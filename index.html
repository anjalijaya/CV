                [as an ambitious young adult currently studying for a computer forensics degree, I have gathered skills that would be helpful in a work environment from working at pizza hut and intercontinental hotel. I was a part of a team that allowed  me to show case my team working skill and make sure we integrate as one. I have effective communication skills and an amazing work ethic proven by my previous jobs.]
